# PPTQ Scheduler
Web server/client for allowing Utah shops to schedule PPTQs with less hassle from the judges


## Objective
Every three months or so, Wizards of the Coast opens up a new season of Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier (PPTQ) events, which every LGS can host. These events require a Level 2 or higher Judge to run, which means in the case of Utah, there are over 20 stores that want the time and attention of about 5 local judges.

Up to this point, we've done a good job coordinating those efforts, but there is still a lot of manual work that has been required to get events scheduled. This project is an effort to minimize that work.

This project is currently a WIP -- I am just poking this when I have some spare time in the interest of automating pieces I hate doing. As the product gets more fleshed out, I will likely turn it into a shippable product that others can use.


## Goals

 - Automated emailing system to notify stores when a new PPTQ season is open to register

 - Calendar application system, so stores can request a date and see if other stores have already conflicted

 - Manual override options for L2 judges (requiring some kind of Auth-system so the L2s can login without letting others through)

 - JudgeApps integrations (?)

   - Authorizing with JudgeApps account?

   - Automatic JudgeApps event creation?
